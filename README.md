# Optimum-Supply-Chain-Prediction
Predict optimum supply of a product to the warehouses to ensure optimum demand supply match to prevent inventory loss

# 1. Business ProblemÂ¶
## 1.1 Description
An FMCG company entered into the instant noodles business two years back. Their higher management has noticed that there is a miss match in the demand and supply. Where the demand is high, supply is pretty low and where the demand is low, supply is pretty high. In both ways, it is an inventory cost loss to the company.
## 1.2 Problem Statement
Since there is a demand supply mismatch, it leads to inventory loss to the company. Therefore company wants to optimize the supply quantity in every warehouse in the entire country.

## 1.4 Real-world/Business objectives and constraints.
- Analyze the demand pattern in different pockets of the country
- Interpretability is important
- Minimize errors as these can lead to inventory loss

## 2.2 Mapping to real-world problem to an ML problem
## 2.2.1 Type of Machine Learning Problem
We have to predict the weight(in tonnes) to be supplied ==> Regression Problem

## 2.2.2 Performance Metric
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-Squared
